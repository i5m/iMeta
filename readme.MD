> ### Project:
> 
> Having a niche like building a Travel Agent, Expert Finder, Online Shopping Helper, Medical Image Checker, or Stock Trend Analyser is good but doesn’t represent what Metaphor intends to do. The whole idea of a platform which can be used by anyone for anything is intriguing and that’s why I created a platform which is free yet can act as a powerful expert to help you find what you’re looking for.
> 
> Introducing iMeta – Redefining Information Retrieval
> 
> - Metaphor's API + ChatGPT LLM: Get meaningful results without browsing multiple content.
> - Multimodal Answers: Text and images as answers for richer insights.
> - Modality Choice: Users can search with text or images for better flexibility.
> - Real-time Mind Mapping: Build dynamic mind maps, question, and strategize searches as they are the future of knowledge exploration.

> ### Building tech
> 
> - **Services**:
>   - Metaphor’s Search and Content API
>   - Wikipedia’s API for Image Access
>   - OpenAI’s Chat Completion API to get richer and concise information from content
>   - HuggingFace ‘Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base’ model for getting information about a picture
> 
> - **Backend**:
>   - Built in Python Flask with production level structure.
>   - Three main routes:
>   - New Search - provides multi-modal information about the search
>   - Image Search - allows user to search internet with an image
>   - Mind Map - ask follow-up questions and strategizing
> 
> - **Frontend**:
>   - It’s a Chrome Extension which can be loaded with one-click
>   - No unnecessary UI or server to display results
>   - Just go to Metahphor’s home page and start searching, results will popup
> 
> - Backend Setup:
>   - Make sure you have all the modules in requirements.txt
>   - Create .env and .flaskenv with required keys
>   - Just do: flask run

> ### Challenges on the API:
> 
> - The contents API returns very unstructured data and is limited to text only.
> - Integrating multiple services together and building a pipeline to use ones data into another was challenging
> - No mention of ‘Keyword’ or ‘Neural’ in Search API docs. I checked the networks tab since the playground gave popup warnings when it thought.

> ### Why am I interested? :)
> 
> I share your passion for revolutionizing information discovery and would eagerly embrace the challenge of recreating Google-level search over a billion pages in just one month. In my previous roles, I've thrived at the intersection of creativity and efficiency, devising innovative solutions while constantly optimizing for user experience. My ability to don multiple hats and my solid grasp of software fundamentals make me an ideal fit for Metaphor.
